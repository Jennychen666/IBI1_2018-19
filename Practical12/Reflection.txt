I met some tricky problems in this pratical.
In the SIR_vaccination model(section 4), the legend showing the probabilities required adding a loop and I amended for several times.
In the Spatial_SIR model(section 5), it was difficult to output the correct plots due to the complicated loop structure.
The process was interesting as the plots were shown and the results were amazing.
