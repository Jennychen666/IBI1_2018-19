# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:


### Feedback Week 3:

- [ ] The site http://jennychen666.github.io/ does not exist. Make sure that the name of the folder for your website is  <username>.github.io

- [ ]  The commit messages for your week 3 files are not informative. They should contain information about what changed from the previous version. For instance, just the name of the file or the word "github" are not very helpful commit messages.

### Feedback Week 4:

- [ ] There is no file called variables.py in your github repository. Don't forget to commit and push your files after each practical!

- [ ] There is no file called Collatz.py

- [ ] The file mystery_code.py exists, but there is no answer to the question of what it does.

- [ ] There is no file called powersof2.py in your github repository


### Feedback Week 5:


- [ ] In the script that counts DNA nucleotides, the code asking for user input works, but it would be even better if the user saw a prompt, such as "Please enter a DNA sequence: " 

- [ ] The code to compute and display nucleotide numbers only works if the sequence is given with spaces between the letters (e.g. "G A T T A C A", not "GATTACA"). This is counter-intuitive. You have two options: Either amend the code so that it works without spaces, or explicitly tell the user that they are required to input the sequence with spaces.


- [ ] The code for reverting words and sorting them works, but it should ask the user for an input string, instead of hard-coding the string in the script.


This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade. 

If this was a summative assessment, you would have scored 46 out of 100
